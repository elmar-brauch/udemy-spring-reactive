# Spring Reactive Udemy course

This code is part of Spring Reactive Udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4669400/?referralCode=E1C590359F1ACD459B0B

Import it into your IDE as Maven project and build it with: 
mvn clean package

Trying the code is done with the JUnit tests,
so use them as starting point to understand the reactive programming.
